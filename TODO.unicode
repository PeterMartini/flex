* Somehow flag '.' to handle fffe / surrogates as illegal codepoints (if desired)

* Flag '.' to match per grapheme rather than per codepoint

* add utf-16 support (csize == 16)

* enforce utf-8 requiring csize 8 (for now)

* Allow utf-8 literals in the source file (ie,
  [a-zâ˜º] would match a-z or WHITE SMILING FACE, rather
  than a-z, \xe2, \x98, or \xb2)

* case-insensitive needs to be much smarter, including handling
  multicharacter case folds

* Add checks for unicode properties
