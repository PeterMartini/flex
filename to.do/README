		This guy Gerhard Wilhelms did an exhaustive line-by-line
		study of flex, finding a large number of glitches; it's
		not clear how significant they are (some have subseuqently
		been fixed).

	Wish-List
		A long list of cryptic one-line descriptions of various

	reentrant
		A set of mods contributed by John Bossom for adding
		an option to flex to make reentrant scanners.

	rflex-2.5.4-diffs
		A set of mods contributed by Chris Appleton for

	streams
		email from David Madden about coping with non-blocking

	unicode
		patches to support Unicode scanners, contributed
		by James A. Lauth.


Of these, the ones that people frequently ask about are support for reentrant
scanners and support for Unicode.  I haven't played with the reentrant stuff
so don't know how solid / well designed it is.  I've sent out the Unicode
stuff to numerous people and haven't received any complaints, so I imagine
it works well.

Another thing people ask for fairly often is removing the limit on size
of the scanners.  There's some mail in the faqs/ directory about ways to
do this by cranking some #define's in flexdef.h, though of course the best
solution would be dynamic memory/resizing.

By the way, I have translated the core flex algorithms into a C++ regular
expression class (but one that doesn't support the uglier stuff like
yymore()/yyless(), trailing context, etc.).  If you ever wind up wanting
it, just let me know.
